To quickly examine an example of the output file produced by the workflow, open ExampleOutputFile.csv.

To generate this file, save Tampa_CV_SampleFileTimeTruncated.csv (the input file without peer reports and corruption), corruptSignalsTampa.m (a helper funciton used in the workflow), post2distance.m (a helper function downloaded from MATLAB file exchange at the link copied below)
and testScriptTrafficSimulatorTampaData.m in the current working directory, and run testScriptTrafficSimulatorTampaData.m.
